# The Maker Club at IUS

The Maker Club at IUS is/was a registered student organization (RSO) at [Indiana University Southeast (IUS)](http://ius.edu/), located in New Albany, Indiana, United States.

The primary purpose was to provide a fun student club for extra curricular activities outside of the normal educational requirements for a degree at Indiana University Southeast with a focus on the hardware aspects of [Informatics](http://ius.edu/natural-sciences/programs/informatics/) and [Computer Science](http://ius.edu/natural-sciences/programs/computer-science/). Primarily the club focused on 3D printing, electronics, and robotics.

The club was founded April 2014 by [Lukas DiBeneditto](http://dibeneditto.com/), [Jeramey Tyler](http://linkedin.com/in/jeramey-tyler-a6441795), and Matthew Ballard. At the time Jeramey Tyler was president of the Association for Computing Machinery student club, and Matthew Ballard was the president of the Computer Security Group student club. The original idea for the club goes to Jon Vaughn who was working on a robot the prior semester, and people wanted to help with it. Lukas DiBeneditto became president.

Prior to being called the Maker Club at IUS it was called IUS Hackerspace, the name was changed primarily because of the general public ignorance associated with "hacking" as a negative connotation. The "hacking" that the club did was more akin to electronic hardware tinkering, not anything related to the bad type of hacking. 

Student members who had influential roles in the beginning included Lukas DiBeneditto, Jeramey Tyler, Matthew Ballard, Shawn Mathes, David Phaire, Bill Blunk, Tim Hollins, William Pister, Zach Volgnier, Joseph Dukes, Ethan Scheldorf, Josh Rowe, Matthew Wayne, and Ryan Nadler.

The primary faculty advisor who was instrumental in the startup of the club was Dr. Chris J. Kimmer Associate Professor of Informatics, who also was able to get a grant to establish the Makerspace 3D Printer Lab in the Library. Dr. John F. Doyle Associate Professor of Computer Science generously provided electronics training for a number of classes and helped to get electronics diagnostic equipment. Dr. Suranga Hettiarachchi Associate Professor of Computer Science helped with providing robotics hardware parts and programming assistance. Dr. Sridhar Ramachandran Associate Professor of Informatics provided advice and space to work on robotics in the BiRG lab.

The club was featured a number of times in the public news media for projects that they had worked on, including a retro style arcade cabinet, an augmented reality sandbox, and for helping train students how to use the 3D printers.
